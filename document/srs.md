# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

The Macau678 Purchase Approval System is a web-based application designed to manage and control purchase requests within Macau678.

The system allows Macau678 staff to submit purchase requests and authorized reviewers to review, approve, reject, or return requests with reasons. It aims to provide a structured approval process, role-based permissions, request history, and reporting.

## 2. Stakeholder Request

An organization needs controlled approval of funding, purchases, travel, reimbursement, or similar requests. Users submit requests; reviewers approve, reject, or return them with reasons. The finished product should provide role permissions, state transitions, history, and reporting. Define reviewer assignment, editing rules after submission, and any multi-stage approval.

For this project, the team focuses on Macau678 purchase requests.

## 7. Assumptions and Decisions

**AD-01:** The system is designed for Macau678 purchase request approval.

**AD-02:** The initial system has two main roles: Requester and Reviewer.

**AD-03:** Each submitted request is assigned to one Reviewer.

**AD-04:** A Reviewer cannot approve or review their own request.

**AD-05:** Requesters can edit requests only after they have been returned.

**AD-06:** Rejection and return decisions require a reason.

**AD-07:** The initial version uses a single approval stage.

**AD-08:** Actual payment and purchasing activities take place outside the system.

**AD-09:** The team may revise these assumptions as requirements become clearer during development.
